# S-Guard Bot Architecture and Development Guide
## Overview
S-Guard is a Discord bot designed to provide security features similar to the discontinued D-Safe bot. This guide outlines the architecture, development practices, and deployment strategies for building S-Guard using modern technologies.
## Architecture Overview
The architecture of S-Guard is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for independent development and deployment of each component. The main components are:
- **Frontend:** A user-friendly dashboard and landing page built with Astro and Tailwind, hosted
    on Vercel.
- **Backend/API:** An Express-based API that handles requests from the frontend and communicates with the Discord bot, hosted on Railway.
- **Discord Bot:** A TypeScript-based bot that interacts with Discord servers, also hosted on Railway.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas is used for storing user data, bot configurations, and other necessary information.
